# Stereo-Localisation

Project with the main goal of locating the sound source, by calculating the distance between the source and two microphones.  
Current solution isn't very convenient as it doesn't allow the microphones to be very far apart from each other (>2m).  
To enhance the precision of the program, better amplitude-distance ratio should be made (possible by better sound quality).
